# etch-a-sketch
Part of Odin course project to build web version of Etch-A-Sketch.

This project will be utlising DOM manipulation skills that I have learned
so far in the course. 

Using flexbox in css and javascript was able to create agrid of desired size

Drawing on the screen is achieved by manipulation of DOM elements and javascript.

Instruction to draw:
    1. To draw, click mouse button inside the canvas.
    2. Move your mouse to draw on the canvas.
    3. To stop drawing, click mouse button again inside the canvas.
