Part of Odin course project to build web version of Etch-A-Sketch.

This project will be utlising DOM manipulation skills that I have learned
so far in the course. 

Using flexbox in css and javascript was able to create agrid of desired size

Drawing on the screen is achieved by manipulation of DOM elements and javascript.

    3. To stop drawing, click mouse button again inside the canvas. 
    4. To change brush size (grid size) slide the slider left to right to desired number.
    5. The canvas will reset automatically. 
    6. To change color of the brush to random color click on randomise
       check box.
